# Summer Research- Reversible Data Hiding in Encrypted Images
This is a repo for my summer research application for reversible data hiding in encrypted images using MSB prediction.

During my summer research, I created a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in which the owner of an original image pre-processes and encrypts the image by using an encryption key Ke and another person embeds an additional message by using a data hiding key Kw. A user can decode such an image through three schemes. If the recipient has only the encryption key, they can only get the pre-processed image but not the embedded message. Conversely, if they only have the watermarking key, they can just extract the message. When the user has both the encryption and the watermarking keys, the recipient can extract the original message and reconstruct the pre-processed image. Therefore, the application enables the user to upload an image, encrypt information, and retrieve that image info with a secret key, using the algorithm that we researched and implemented throughout the investigation process.
